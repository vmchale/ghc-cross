Here you'll find GHC cross-compilers for `arm-linux-gnueabihf` and
`aarch64-linux-gnu` targets.

# Dependencies

You should download and install [GMP](https://gmplib.org/#DOWNLOAD), for the
target platform, and you
should have appropriate C compilers installed.

On Debian:

```
sudo apt install gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu
```

or

```
sudo apt install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf
```

You will need to have [LLVM 6.0](http://releases.llvm.org/download.html#6.0.0)
installed on the host.
