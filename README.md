Here you'll find GHC cross-compilers for `arm-linux-gnueabihf` and
`aarch64-linux-gnu`.

You should download and install [GIMP](https://gmplib.org/#DOWNLOAD), and you
should have appropriate C compilers installed.

You will need to have [LLVM 6.0](http://releases.llvm.org/download.html#6.0.0)
installed on the host.
